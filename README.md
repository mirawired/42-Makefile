# 42 School Makefile

Simple Makefile template for 42 C language school projects.

## Features :
- Libft and Minilibx ready.
- Compiles *.o in a separate folder created at compilation time
- Check for *.h update when make command is called

## Folder tree :
Your folder should be ordered this way
```bash
program_name/
├─ inc/
├─ src/
├─ libft/
├─ minilibx-linux/
├─ Makefile
```

## Tips
Makefile seems shady at first glance but reading (at least the first part) of the [official GNU make man](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html/)  should enlight its obscurantism.

Then, don't hesitate to test and look at other coders Makefile's to grasp the subtleties.

Good luck and don't panic (really !).
